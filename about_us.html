          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>
          Developed by faculty, staff and students at NYU, and members of NYC communities most impacted by imprisonment, including formerly incarcerated people, our initiative is intended to address inequalities that shape our educational environment. We are committed to models of collaborative learning that emphasize principles of social engagement and critical reflection. We view education within prisons as part of a broader effort to change how we think about incarceration and its collateral effects throughout our city, state and nation.
          </p>

        <h1>
        What We Do
        </h1>
          <p>We currently offer educational programming leading to an Associate of Arts (AA) Degree in Liberal Studies at Wallkill Correctional Facility, located in Ulster County, NY. By offering transferrable credits and education support services, we are committed to developing educational opportunities both for our students in prison and upon their release.

        </div>

        <div class="col3">
            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
          <p>We are New York University faculty, staff, students and community partners committed to providing access to higher education for people in prisons and jails.  We view the promotion of higher education opportunities for those experiencing incarceration as a contribution to the creation of a more humane and just society, and as a reflection of NYU’s commitment to public service.
